I have total 9 yrs experience out of which 2 years was on a project in which
i was working some devops related tools and technology
e-commerce plateform but some confidential i can't disclose the name
they had to scale their operations in india so they need cloud service, i workied on terraform, 
k8s, aws cloud, docker, private repository, jenkins ci/cd and that got me interested in devops 
hence i am looking for more challenges

"Good morning/afternoon, my name is Imtiyaj Ansari, and I bring 9 years of IT experience with 4 years spent working in a 
Network Operations Center (NOC) environment. In my NOC role, I developed strong skills in monitoring, incident management, 
and troubleshooting complex issues across critical production systems, ensuring uptime and quick resolution of service disruptions."

"Over the last couple of years, Iâ€™ve focused on expanding my knowledge in cloud technologies, specifically AWS. 
Iâ€™ve gained hands-on experience with core AWS services such as EC2, S3, IAM, CloudWatch, VPC, and Route 53, 
and Iâ€™ve successfully worked on several personal projects to simulate production-like environments. 
Iâ€™ve also implemented automated backups, disaster recovery strategies, and monitoring solutions in AWS."


"One of the personal projects I worked on to strengthen my AWS expertise was setting up a high-availability, 
production-style web application environment on AWS, with built-in monitoring, automation, and disaster recovery capabilities."

ðŸ”§ Project Overview:
Architecture:

Deployed a basic web application on EC2 instances in two Availability Zones using an Auto Scaling Group and an Application Load 
Balancer (ALB).

Configured Route 53 with health checks for DNS failover.

Stored logs and app data in Amazon S3.

Security & Access:

Used IAM roles and policies for least-privileged access.

Configured Security Groups and NACLs for instance-level protection.

ðŸ“ˆ Monitoring & Support:
Enabled CloudWatch Alarms for CPU, memory, and disk thresholds.

Used CloudWatch Logs for system log collection and analysis.

Created SNS notifications to receive alerts in case of threshold breaches or instance health check failures.

Practiced real-time troubleshooting using:

CloudTrail for activity tracking,

VPC flow logs to inspect traffic issues, and

EC2 system logs for OS-level insights.

ðŸ’¾ Backup & Disaster Recovery:
Automated Backups:

Enabled daily snapshots of EBS volumes using AWS Backup.

Configured lifecycle policies to automatically delete old backups after 30 days to manage costs.

S3 Backup Strategy:

Implemented versioning and S3 lifecycle policies to move older data to S3 Glacier for long-term, cost-effective storage.

Ensured cross-region replication (CRR) of S3 buckets to another AWS region for geo-redundancy.

Database Backup:

Simulated using Amazon RDS with automated backups and multi-AZ failover for the backend.

Performed manual snapshots before key changes and tested point-in-time recovery.

Disaster Recovery Testing:

Conducted failover simulation by intentionally stopping instances and verifying:

Auto Scaling recovery,

DNS failover through Route 53,

Data accessibility from S3 in the replicated region.
